### Wesnoth

This folder contains resources extracted from the [github repo](https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth) for the open-source strategy game [The Battle for Wesnoth](http://wesnoth.org/).

We will use them as component inputs, to train ourselves in dealing with rendering more complex data objects.
