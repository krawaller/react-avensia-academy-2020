### Wesnoth

This folder contains resources extracted from the [github repo](https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth) for the open-source strategy game [The Battle for Wesnoth](http://wesnoth.org/).

We will use them as component inputs, to train ourselves in dealing with rendering more complex data objects.

The primary artifacts are:

- `units.json` - an ID-indexet library of Wesnoth unit objects
- `races.json` - same as above, but per race
- `base64.json` - a name-indexed object of base 64 images, to be used for various things in the unit data
